A Simulation of a life of a bug using c# and solid design principles

- simulation happens on the simulation field
- bugs can move on the field according to their configuration trying to find food to stay alive
- there is food growing on the field with x,y coordinates
- food can either grow or get eaten by bug
- after every bug move he either eats(increases his life) or starves(decrease of live)

TO DO:
- add big bugs searching for small bugs to eat them
- write the simulation asynchronously
